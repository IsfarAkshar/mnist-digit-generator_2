# 🧠 MNIST Digit Generator (DCGAN)

This project trains a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) on the MNIST dataset to generate realistic handwritten digits 5 times. The webpage is published and you can check it out here https://mnist-digit-generator2-fxfpjhvvgceejz2f7jcrsk.streamlit.app/

## 📊 Features

- 🧠 **DCGAN Architecture** – Generator & Discriminator models built using Conv/TransposeConv layers  
- 🔁 **Training Loop** – Epoch-wise training with visual logging  
- 📁 **Output Directory** – Saves generated digits per epoch  
- 📷 **Image Sampling** – Real-time visualization of model progress  
- 🧪 **Evaluation** – Visual inspection of digit quality across epochs

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
    ```

2. Run the training script:

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

3. Check generated digit samples in the `outputs/` folder after each epoch.
